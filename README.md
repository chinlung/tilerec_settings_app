# ATTO Digital TileRec Settings App
This app will find the RECORD folder of the ATTO and allow you to quickly create the appropriate settings files.

## Windows Users
Your TileRec should be found automatically. You can even try out this Alpha release without needing to build the software:

## Mac Users
Add your RECORD folder as a search path and from that point on the path will be saved and automatically detected when you mount/unmount the device. The default mount point for external drives on Mac is /Volumes.
Note: On my Mac Book Pro the TileRec seems to re-mount itself automatically after I eject the drive so you may need to quickly remove the drive from the USB port after you Eject it or you will get a warning that it was not properly removed. You can try out the Alpha release here:
