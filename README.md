# ATTO Digital TileRec Settings App
This app will find the RECORD folder of the ATTO and allow you to quickly create the appropriate settings files.

## Windows Users
Your TileRec should be found automatically. You can even try out this Alpha release without needing to build the software:

## Mac Users
In theory this application will work for you as well. Add your Record folder as a search path and from that point on the path will be saved and automatically detected when you mount/unmount the device. Unfortunately, I don't have time to create the XCode project for this so you'll need to download the latest version of Qt and create a project for the source files. There aren't many, so don't be afraid!
